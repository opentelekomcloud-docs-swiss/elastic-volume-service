Overview
========

Welcome to *Elastic Volume Service API Reference*. Elastic Volume Service (EVS) offers scalable block storage for servers. With high reliability, high performance, and a variety of specifications, EVS disks can be used for distributed file systems, development and test environments, data warehouse applications, and high-performance computing (HPC) scenarios to meet diverse service requirements.

This document describes how to use application programming interfaces (APIs) to perform operations on EVS resources, such as creating, querying, deleting, and updating an EVS resource. For details about all supported operations, see :ref:`API Overview <en-us_topic_0124881427>`.

Before calling an EVS API, ensure that you are familiar with the EVS concepts. For details, see **Service Overview** in the *Elastic Volume Service User Guide*.
