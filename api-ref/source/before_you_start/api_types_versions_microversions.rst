================================

API Type Description
--------------------

EVS APIs are classified as follows:

-  APIs for EVS with customized specifications, which are also referred to as APIs
-  Native OpenStack APIs that comply with OpenStack community specifications, which are also referred to as OpenStack Cinder APIs

The two types of APIs offer similar functions but are used in different scenarios. OpenStack Cinder APIs are used to meet open-source ecosystem requirements, while APIs for EVS with customized specifications are developed based on native OpenStack APIs with the following enhanced functions:

API Version Description
-----------------------

EVS custom APIs provide multiple versions. If those APIs offer the same functions, you are advised to use the v2 APIs.

OpenStack Cinder APIs provide v2 and v3 versions, and OpenStack Cinder v3 APIs support microversions.
