If I Detach a Disk, Will I Lose the Data on My Disk?
====================================================

Data on a disk will not be lost after the disk is detached, and the disk can be re-attached later if needed.

To ensure your data safety, you are advised to follow the instructions described in :ref:`Disk Detachment Process <evs_faq_0012__section1567714137557>`.

Disk Detachment Process
-----------------------

-  For disks not supporting online detachment:

   #. Stop the server where the disk was attached.
   #. After the server has stopped, detach the disk.

-  For disks supporting online detachment:

   Detach the disk from a running ECS. For details, see **Management** > **Detaching an EVS Disk from a Running ECS** in the *Elastic Cloud Server User Guide*.
