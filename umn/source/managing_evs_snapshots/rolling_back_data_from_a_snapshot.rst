Rolling Back Data from a Snapshot
=================================

Scenarios
---------

If the data on an EVS disk is incorrect or damaged, you can roll back the data from a snapshot to the source disk to restore data. Snapshot rollback has the following constraints:

Constraints
-----------

-  A snapshot can be rolled back only to its source disk. Rollback to another disk is not possible.
-  A snapshot can be rolled back only when the snapshot status is **Available** and the source disk status is **Available** (not attached to any server) or **Rollback failed**.
-  A snapshot whose name starts with **autobk_snapshot_vbs\_**, **manualbk_snapshot_vbs\_**, **autobk_snapshot_csbs\_**, or **manualbk_snapshot_csbs\_** is automatically generated by the system during backup. Such a snapshot can only be viewed. It cannot be used to roll back the disk data.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Under **Storage**, click **Elastic Volume Service**.

#. In the navigation pane on the left, choose **Elastic Volume Service** > **Snapshots**.

   The snapshot list page is displayed.

#. In the snapshot list, locate the row that contains the target snapshot and click **Roll Back Disk** in the **Operation** column.

#. In the displayed dialog box, click **Yes**.

#. The snapshot list is displayed. After the snapshot status changes from **Rolling back** to **Available**, the data rollback is successful.
