Increasing EVS Resource Quotas
==============================

Scenarios
---------

Quotas are enforced for service resources on the platform to prevent unforeseen spikes in resource usage. Quotas can limit the number or amount of resources available to users, such as the number of EVS disks, the capacity of EVS disks, and the number of EVS snapshots.

If your resource quotas fail to meet service requirements, perform the following operations to increase quotas.

How Do I Apply for a Higher Quota?
----------------------------------

The system does not support online quota adjustment. If you need to adjust a quota, contact the operations administrator.

Before contacting the operations administrator, make sure that the following information has been obtained:

-  Domain name, project name, and project ID, which can be obtained by performing the following operations:

   Log in to the management console using the cloud account, click the username in the upper right corner, select **My Credentials** from the drop-down list, and obtain the domain name, project name, and project ID on the **My Credentials** page.

-  Quota information, which includes:

   -  Service name
   -  Quota type
   -  Required quota
